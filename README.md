My name is Julio Cachay. I am a full stack developer in Chattanooga, Tn. I work at a great company: Datably Inc.

I like to write code I can feel proud of, so, I spend a lot of time an energy researching, and learning best practices. 

I love solving complex problems and learning new technologies, and my job allows me to do exactly that.

I switched careers late in life, like many people do. It took me a few years of constant, hard work to get were I am now. When I started, it was overwhelming.

Now I can look back and feel proud and and happy of the things I achieved.

Sometimes, I post code in this repo as an example for other developers, specially those who are starting in this path. 

To do so is hard and intimidating, but like everything, if you keep pushing you will get there. The trick, I think, is to enjoy the profession, to be passionate about it and never stop learning.

By the way, you know what is pretty fun and useful? Domain Driven Design. 

This one is a work in progress, but is a great example: [soccer project](https://github.com/jcachayG93/soccer-time)

This one is a demo on how to use Asp.Net core middleware to centralize app behavior: [Middleware example[(https://github.com/jcachayG93/exception-handler-middleware-example)

What about the other Repos?
Most of them are just experiments I made over the years.
