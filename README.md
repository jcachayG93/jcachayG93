My name is Julio Cachay. I am a full-stack developer in Chattanooga, TN. I work at a great company: Datably Inc.

I like to write code I can feel proud of, so I spend a lot of time and energy researching and learning best practices. 

I love solving complex problems and learning new technologies; my job allows me to do that.

I switched careers late in life, like many people do. It took me a few years of constant, hard work to get where I am now. When I started, it was overwhelming.

Now, I can look back and feel proud and happy about my achievements.

Sometimes, I post code in this repo as an example for other developers, especially those starting this path. 

Doing so is complicated and intimidating, but like everything, if you keep pushing, you will get there. This is easier if you enjoy the profession, are passionate about it, and never stop learning.
