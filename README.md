I have a vast background in Business, marketing, and engineering, with experience in first-of-kind projects that require innovation and creativity.

I decided to become a software developer in 2017, spent the time and energy necessary to learn best practices, and experimented with different techniques to make my code easy to understand and change.

I have demonstrated my ability to solve complex software problems by applying solid engineering principles, creativity, and theoretical knowledge to produce high-quality software efficiently.

I am highly adaptable and can easily pick up new languages, understand legacy systems, and think creatively to solve a wide range of problems.


I am a goal-oriented developer who always keeps up to date with the latest state of the craft.
